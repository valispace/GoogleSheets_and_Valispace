GoogleSheets and Valispace
==========================

An example of the script for writing data from Valispace to Google Sheets. A similar
algorithm for writing data from Google Sheets to Valispace.

 

1.  Set up Google Sheets API:
    <https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python>

2.  Get `credentials.json` file, do not push this file to Git. Put a path to this
    file into `example.py`

3.  After the first run of the script and authorization, a file `token.pickle`
    will appear in your folder

4.  Install Valispace python API:
    <https://github.com/valispace/ValispacePythonAPI>

5.  Create an Excel spreadsheet directly in Google Drive (an imported Excel
    file could not work) and get a spreadsheet ID from the spreadsheet link

6.  Go through `example.py`!
